</h2>

- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)- Next.js is a framework built on top of React.
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) - Typescript is a superset of the common JavaScript. With that, we can type and maintain our code easier.
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) - Styled components is a CSS-in-JS library.
- [React Testing Library](https://testing-library.com/) - React Testing Library is a library that allows us to create unit and integration tests of React components.
- [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/) - Storybook is an open source tool for building UI components and pages in isolation. It streamlines UI development, testing, and documentation.
- [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) and [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) - With ESLint and Prettier, we can improve our code quality by linting and auto formating it. -->

- [ ] User can sign in in order to save his/her boards data into a database, this way the user will be able to acess his/her boards from any browser in any computer, not only the browser that has the localStorage data set
  - [ ] Sign in with Google
  - [ ] Sign in with Github
- [ ] User can change his/her profile data (name, title, picture)
