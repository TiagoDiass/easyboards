  :clipboard: Features
</h2>

- [x] User can drag and drop tasks into columns
- [x] User can reorder the columns by dragging and dropping them
- [x] User can create tasks
- [x] User can delete tasks
- [x] User can create columns
- [x] User can delete columns
- [x] User can edit a column name
- [x] The board data is persisted into the browser's localStorage so the user will not loose his/her board data
- [x] The application starts with a simple first board so the user can start using the app without having to create his/her own board. A starter board also helps users to get to know the app when they are having their first contact with that
- [x] User can change the application's theme from light to dark mode (and the theme is persisted into the browser's localStorage so the application will keep the selected theme)
- [x] User can create multiple boards:
  - [x] User can create a board starting from a starter template (basic Kanban template)
  - [x] User can create a board starting with no template (that is, the board will start empty instead of with the basic Kanban columns)
- [x] User can change a board name
- [x] User can delete a board
- [ ] Custom 404 page to tell user that he/she tried to access a board that doesn't exist
- [ ] Multilanguage (English and Portuguese)
- [ ] User can change a board background
- [ ] User can sign in in order to save his/her boards data into a database, this way the user will be able to acess his/her boards from any browser in any computer, not only the browser that has the localStorage data set
  - [ ] Sign in with Google
  - [ ] Sign in with Github
- [ ] User can change his/her profile data (name, title, picture)

  :rocket: Deploy
</h2>

I have deployed this application on [Vercel](https://vercel.com/). It's configured with a continuous deployment with this Github repository, that is, everytime the codebase from the `main` branch of this repository gets updated, Vercel will trigger a build of the project and will put it in production.

### ðŸ“š Storybook

Storybook is a live documentation of the application components. It helps developers that are getting to know the codebase, designers that want to validate the components implemented by the developers, developer that want to know how to use any component of the app and so on. I have deployed the Storybook of this app on Vercel with a continuous deployment just like the application itself.

this way you'll stop the app

### Tests
To run the application tests, follow the steps below (assuming you have followed the first steps above)
```
# Run the tests
$ yarn test

# If you want to run the tests in order to see the code coverage, run:
$ yarn test:coverage
```
### Storybook
Storybook is a live documentation of all components that were developed to use in this app. To start the Storybook, just follow the steps below (assuming you have followed the first steps above)
```
